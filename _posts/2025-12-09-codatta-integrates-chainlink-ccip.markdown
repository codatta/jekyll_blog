We're excited to announce that **Codatta has integrated Chainlink CCIP** (Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol) to **enable secure, reliable, and native cross-chain transfers of XNY across Base and BNB Chain**.

Chainlink CCIP is the industry standard for secure cross-chain communication. It supports arbitrary messaging, token transfer and programmable token transfer. By integrating CCIP, Codatta ensures that XNY can move across chains with the same security standards.

This integration marks a key milestone in Codatta's multi-chain expansion and strengthens its long-term vision of building an open, verifiable knowledge infrastructure where human intelligence becomes onchain data assets accessible to both humans and AI agents across ecosystems.

**About Chainlink**

Chainlink is the industry-standard oracle platform bringing the capital markets onchain and powering the majority of decentralized finance (DeFi). The Chainlink stack provides the essential data, interoperability, compliance, and privacy standards needed to power advanced blockchain use cases for institutional tokenized assets, lending, payments, stablecoins, and more. Since inventing decentralized oracle networks, Chainlink has enabled tens of trillions in transaction value and now secures the vast majority of DeFi. 

Many of the world's largest financial services institutions have also adopted Chainlink's standards and infrastructure, including Swift, Euroclear, Mastercard, Fidelity International, UBS, ANZ, and top protocols such as Aave, GMX, Lido, and many others. Chainlink leverages a novel fee model where offchain and onchain revenue from enterprise adoption is converted to LINK tokens and stored in a strategic [Chainlink Reserve](https://blog.chain.link/chainlink-reserve-strategic-link-reserve/).
