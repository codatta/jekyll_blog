We live in a world where a few centralized entities control the most powerful AI models. These models are trained on the collective knowledge of humanity, yet the value generated is captured by a handful of corporations. We built Codatta to change this paradigm.

## The Knowledge Layer

Codatta is more than just a data marketplace; it is the knowledge layer for the AI era. We believe that:

*   **Your Data is Your Asset**: You should own your digital footprint and be compensated when it's used.
*   **Transparency Builds Trust**: AI should be accountable, and that starts with transparent training data.
*   **Collaboration is Key**: The best AI will be built by a global community of contributors, not a siloed lab.

## Join the Revolution

We are building a future where everyone can participate in the AI economy. Whether you are a researcher, a developer, or a content creator, there is a place for you in the Codatta ecosystem. Together, let's build an AI future that benefits everyone.
