In the age of AI, data is the new oil. But unlike oil, data can be copied, altered, and forged with ease. As we rely more on AI-generated content and decisions, knowing the source of the data that trained these models is becoming a critical security requirement.

## The Problem of Black Box AI

Most AI models are "black boxes." We don't know exactly what data went into them. This lack of transparency leads to issues with bias, copyright infringement, and hallucination.

## Blockchain as the Trust Layer

Blockchain technology offers a solution through immutable data lineage. By recording the hash of every data point and its contributor on-chain, we create an unalterable history of the dataset.

*   **Provenance**: We know exactly who contributed the data.
*   **Integrity**: We can verify that the data hasn't been tampered with.
*   **Attribution**: Contributors can be fairly compensated for their intellectual property.

Codatta's protocol utilizes this transparency to build a marketplace where data buyers can trust the quality and legality of the assets they purchase.
