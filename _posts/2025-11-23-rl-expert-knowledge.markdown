Reinforcement Learning (RL) has been a cornerstone of AI development, enabling agents to learn by trial and error. However, in complex real-world scenarios, trial and error can be inefficient or even dangerous. This is where Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) comes into play, and more specifically, pairing it with real-world knowledge from domain experts.

## The Role of the Expert

Standard RLHF often relies on crowd-sourced feedback which can be noisy or superficial. By integrating verified domain experts into the feedback loop, we can guide AI agents towards more robust and accurate behaviors.

### Benefits of Expert-in-the-Loop
1.  **Accelerated Convergence**: Experts provide high-quality signals that help the model learn faster.
2.  **Safety and Alignment**: Domain experts can identify subtle edge cases and safety risks that laypeople might miss.
3.  **Nuanced Understanding**: Experts can reward complex reasoning chains, not just final answers.

At Codatta, we are building a platform where experts are incentivized to provide this critical feedback, directly influencing the next generation of AI models.
