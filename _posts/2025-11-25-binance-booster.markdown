We are thrilled to share our experience participating in the Binance Booster program. As a project at the intersection of AI and Blockchain, finding the right partners to scale is essential.

## Why Binance Booster?

Binance has cultivated one of the most vibrant ecosystems in the crypto space. The Booster program offered us not just funding, but invaluable mentorship and access to a vast network of industry leaders.

## Key Takeaways

1.  **Strategic Mentorship**: We received hands-on guidance on tokenomics and go-to-market strategy.
2.  **Technical Support**: Access to BNB Chain's technical resources helped us optimize our protocol for high throughput.
3.  **Community Growth**: The exposure to the Binance community significantly expanded our user base.

This partnership marks a significant milestone in Codatta's roadmap, propelling us closer to our vision of a decentralized data economy.
